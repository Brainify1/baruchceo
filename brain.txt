Email automation:

Trial Users - Send them, one insight every two days, (4 total) during their first 7 Days (Trial)
Paid/Active Users - Send them, one insight every 3 days, ongoing.


Given a list of Users:
- Is user Paid or Trial?
- How many have we sent so far?
- When did we send them last isight?
- When should we send them next insight? (Logic or implicit in code)

- Stripe logic, look for isPaid before sending insights.. || Users will change status at any given time.
